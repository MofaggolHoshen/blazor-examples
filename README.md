# Blazor Examples

A collection of Blazor example projects demonstrating real-world problems and their solutions. Each project focuses on specific challenges developers face when building Blazor applications.

## 📚 Projects

### 1. BlazorjQueryIntegration

#### a. Understanding Race Conditions in Blazor + JavaScript Integration

A race condition occurs when two or more operations execute concurrently and compete to access or modify the same resource, with the final outcome depending on unpredictable timing. In Blazor + JavaScript integration, this happens when Blazor's rendering engine and JavaScript code simultaneously attempt to manipulate the same DOM elements, leading to conflicts, errors, and inconsistent application state.

**Documentation:** 📖 [Race Condition Guide](./BlazorjQueryIntegration/Docs/RaceConditionGuide.md) | 🚀 [Demo Component](./BlazorjQueryIntegration/Components/Pages/RaceConditionDemo.razor)

#### b. jQuery DataTable Integration
